I'm a graduate from the University of Maryland, College Park who is broadly interested in security.  Below is a more specific list of my current interests or fields I'd otherwise want to explore: 

* Zero-knowledge proofs
* Cryptographic engineering
* Software exploitation and reverse engineering
* Automated program analysis and formal verification
* Compilers (optimizations, infrastructure) 

I sometimes play capture the flags (CTFs) with [DiceGang](https://ctftime.org/team/109452/), though I've been kind of inactive lately.  I mostly focus on solving cryptography challenges, though I occasionally branch out into other categories.



I am a strong believer in open-sourcing my work, and I hope that every software engineer strives to do the same.
